/**
 * Text in, 24 kHz PCM out: one text-to-speech request per sentence, read in the
 * order the sentences were written.
 *
 * There is no session and no socket here, and that is what keeps the rest simple.
 * "The reply is over" is something this file works out for itself — the queue is
 * dry and the audio it sent has had time to play — rather than a server event that
 * has to be counted; and cancelling is one `abort()` rather than swallowing the
 * acknowledgements of sends that no longer belong to a turn. A session that dies
 * mid-reply used to mute the connection for good — there is no longer a session to
 * lose, and a failed sentence costs that sentence.
 *
 * `onDone` waits out the audio because synthesis finishes long before the listener
 * does. Reporting the turn over when the last byte was *sent* would put the caller
 * back in its listening state while the reply is still audibly playing, and someone
 * talking over it then reads as a new instruction instead of a barge-in.
 *
 * Requests run one at a time, which is what keeps sentences in order and is why
 * text arriving fast can never pre-empt audio already being read. Synthesis outruns
 * playback by about three to one, so the queue does not starve and only the first
 * sentence's latency (~0.9s to first audio) is one the user can feel. Text is cut
 * at sentence boundaries on the way in, so audio starts long before Claude has
 * finished a paragraph — and the first sentence of a turn is cut as short as it
 * comes, because it is the only one anyone is waiting for.
 *
 * How the reply is read — brisk, slow, whatever — is the `voice` prompt, which the
 * phone saves and this file puts in front of each sentence. The API has no rate
 * parameter, so the wording is the only knob: over the same paragraph, plain reads
 * at 66 ms/character, "Read this at a brisk, quick pace" at 44, "Read this slowly"
 * at 95.
 *
 * Lifted from the web app's tts-session.ts + buffer.ts, at the `web-app` tag.
 *
 *   node voice.ts "Hello there. How are you?"     write reply.pcm, print timings

/**
 * Accumulate streamed text and emit it a sentence at a time.
 *
 * Two rules, and the first one is the whole latency story:
 *
 *   - The **first** sentence of a turn goes out at its first `. ! ?`, however
 *     short. It is the only sentence anyone is waiting for, and Claude's opening
 *     line is short by design — "Sure." "On it." — so a minimum length here means
 *     waiting for the *second* sentence before any sound at all.
 *   - Every sentence after it waits for `minChars`, because by then audio is
 *     already playing and the minimum buys smoother phrasing at no cost.
 *
 * Cutting the first sentence short means the queue can run dry while the second
 * request is still in flight, since requests are serial. Measured on "Sure." — a
 * second's worth of audio — the queue was empty for 66 ms, which is shorter than a
 * syllable. If a shorter opener ever makes that audible, the fix is to let one
 * request run ahead of the sentence being read, not to go back to waiting.
 *
 * One invariant under both rules: text is handed over only at a pause. A request
 * that ends mid-phrase is read with a full-sentence fall, and the next one starts
 * with a fresh rise, so the seam is audible however fast the audio arrives — heard
 * on a 209-character opening sentence, cut at the cap a few words in. So the cap is
 * not a cutter. `maxWaitMs` after a chunk starts waiting it *widens what counts as
 * a pause*, from a full stop to a clause break — comma, dash, colon — and the same
 * scan then cuts at the last of those. Prose meant to be spoken has one every few
 * words, so the ceiling holds within a beat of where it was, and the fragment ends
 * on a breath. Text with no pause in it at all is not speech and waits for the
 * turn's end, where `flush` sends it whole.
 *
 * The timer is per chunk: it starts when the buffer stops being empty and is not
 * restarted by later text. Restarting it meant it never fired while Claude
 * streamed, so a reply slow to reach a full stop was not read until the turn ended.
