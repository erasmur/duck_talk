/**
 * `duck-talk` — the relay, started in whatever folder you are standing in.
 *
 * This file is the whole entry point, in the repo and in the package alike: the
 * shebang survives compilation, so `bin` points straight at the built version of it
 * and there is no wrapper script whose only job is to import this one.
 *
 * That folder is the whole of the configuration: it is the project Claude works in,
 * so it decides which chats the drawer lists and what `?resume=` can carry on, and it
 * is where the relay keeps what it learns — see paths.ts. Point your phone at the
 * printed address and the conversation is about the code you are in.
 *
 * Everything this parses is also an environment variable, because the relay reads
 * environment variables and nothing else: a flag is set here and then handed on, so
 * there is one place that decides and one place that reads.
 *
 *   duck-talk                       serve this folder on :8765
 *   duck-talk --port 9000 --cwd ~/work/api
 *   duck-talk --awake               and keep this Mac from idle sleep meanwhile
