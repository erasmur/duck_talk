/**
 * Claude Code as one long-lived session per chat. Instructions go in
 * through `send`, text and tool blocks come back through callbacks, and a `result`
 * ends each turn. The session stays warm between turns — the first turn pays the
 * ~3s startup, every turn after is ~1s to first token — and `interrupt` stops the
 * current turn without tearing the session down, which is what barge-in needs. That
 * warmth is why the `claude` prompt is read once here and not per turn.
 *
 * Per chat, not per socket: a session belongs to the conversation it is having, and
 * the socket is only whoever is looking at it right now. `claim` is the one door —
 * resuming a chat whose session is still alive reattaches to it instead of spawning a
 * second process onto the same transcript, and `attach` points the running turn's
 * stream at the new socket — which already holds the transcript, so nothing is
 * replayed. `release` is the other side: detaching leaves a busy
 * session to finish on its own (capped by DRAIN_MS, reattachable until then) and
 * closes an idle one, because nothing could ever send to it again.
 *
 * Three things about the session are not fixed that way: which model answers, what it
 * is allowed to do, and how hard it thinks. All are requests the CLI takes mid-session,
 * so `set` puts them on the running session and they hold from the next turn — which is
 * why they reach here as a message from the phone rather than as something chosen when
 * the socket opened. `capabilities()` is the other side of that: the models this Mac can
 * actually offer — each with the effort levels it takes — asked of the CLI instead of
 * written down here.
 *
 * Lifted from the web app's claude-client.ts (the `web-app` tag), but stateful: that
 * backend spawned a fresh subprocess per turn via `resume`, where this keeps one
 * streaming query alive.
 *
 * Subagents need nothing of their own here. The SDK runs them inside the turn and
 * stamps every frame they produce with `parent_tool_use_id`, so they arrive as blocks
 * like any other and the only question is whose they are — see `Block.parent`.
 *
 * A *background* task — an agent or a shell the model sent off to work while the
 * conversation goes on — outlives the turn that launched it, and three facts follow.
 * An interrupt must not kill it, which `perTaskStopAffordance` in the options is for;
 * stopping one is something you ask the model to do, the same way you started it.
 * A close must not kill it either, so `close` drains: the subprocess stays up until
 * the last task settles (or a cap), and only then exits. And when one settles, the
 * CLI says so with a `task_notification` and then opens a turn of its own to narrate
 * the result — a turn no `send` asked for, matched by `ambient` below rather than by
 * a stamp, because a turn Claude starts is still a turn.
 *
 *   node claude.ts "what is the latest commit"     one turn, streamed to stdout
